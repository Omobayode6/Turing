When is the new data available for render? => **After the component re-renders**
26. What is a potential issue with this setState usage?
this.setState({value: this.state.value + 1}); => **It may lead to outdated values due to the asynchronous nature of setState**
27. Identify the issue in this code:
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
render() {
return

{this.state.count}
; } } => **State is not initialized in the constructor**
28. Identify the issue in this code:
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
render() {
return

39. How can you prevent a component from rendering in React? => **Return null in the render method**

{isLoggedIn && } => **if isLoggedIn is true**
41. How does the following code render different components?
{isLoggedIn ? : } => **Renders if isLoggedIn is true, otherwise**
42. Identify the issue in this conditional rendering code:
{isLoggedIn ? } => **Missing the false condition**
43. What's wrong with this code snippet for conditional rendering?
{isLoggedIn && || } => **It combines two different conditional rendering patterns incorrectly**

52. How do you collect form input values in React? => **By storing the values in the state on every change**
53. What is the main difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React? => **Controlled components manage their own state, while uncontrolled components store their state in the DOM**
54. How would you create a basic text input field in a React component? => **<input type='text' value={this.state.value}/>**
55. What is the correct way to handle a form input change in React? => **onChange={(event) => this.setState({value: event.target.value})}**

constructor(props) {
super(props);
this.state = { value: '' };
} render() {
return <Child value={this.state.value} onChange={value => this.setState({value})} />; } } => **onChange handler in Child is not implemented correctly**
